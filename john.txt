john and the unicorn

add indigo

I am a person who tends to live by rules.
Now granted, they are mostly rules I set for myselfâ€”but they are still rules.
I find that creating rules for myself helps me to function better, because I pre-decide things ahead of time instead of making all kinds of decisions on the fly.
